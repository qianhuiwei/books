## Features
* Set up an API server [JSON Server](https://www.npmjs.com/package/json-server) to store books data.
* Used [Rest Client](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=humao.rest-client) extension to send HTTP requests and perform CRUD operation.
* Used React hooks to perform tasks in different life cycle stage (useEffect) and share global data between components (useContext).
* Created custom hooks to reduce code duplication.
* Tested with Chrome.

## Run the app
1. Clone the repository.
2. In terminal, run ```npm run server``` to start the JSON server.
3. Open another terminal window, run ```npm start``` to start the React server.
